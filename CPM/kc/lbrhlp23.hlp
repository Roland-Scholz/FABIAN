LBRHLP is a ZCPR3 utility to display Z-System help files.  The targeted 
help files can be members of libraries or stand-alone, compressed or not.  
Two versions of LBRHLP are supplied:  LHC handles GEL crunched files and 
LHQ handles squeezed files.  Either version will handle uncompressed files.

                                   USAGE 


     LBRHLP {-{dir:}library} {{dir:}hlpfile}


If no DIR or DU specification is given, the current drive and user are 
assumed.  If a library name is given, a leading hyphen ("-") is required.  
If only the name of a help file is given, and that name is preceded by a 
directory specification, LBRHLP searches for a matching stand-alone help 
file.  The directory specification may be in the form D:, U:, DU:, DIR:, or 
a colon alone for the current directory.

The library name and the help file name default to internally configured 
names.  If the default library name is empty, LBRHLP works in stand-alone 
mode by default.  The default filetype for help files is H?P.  If a 
matching file or library is not found in the given or current directory, 
the configured alternate named directory will also be searched.  If no 
named directory with that name is found, the configured alternate 
drive/user will be searched.

 USAGE (continued): 

The program allows you to specify a different Library and or help file from 
the command line:

Example 1:     lbrhlp -c15:special syslib

With this example we told the program that we wanted a different library on 
c15 and a help file called syslib.  The (-) must precede the drive/user or 
library name, if the default D/U is wanted.

Example 2:     lbrhlp syslib

With this we told the program that we wanted the default LBR with the 
filename syslib. If the default LBR is empty, the file syslib is assumed as 
stand-alone file.

Example 3:     lbrhlp -helps

With this we are specifing just the library, using the default DU/DIR and 
default filename.

 USAGE (continued): 

If the default library name is installed, access to stand-alone files can 
be simplified by use of a simple ARUNZ alias:

     HLP  lbrhlp $td1$tu1:$tf1

Via this alias, no directory specification is needed if the help file is in 
the current directory.  Just "HLP filename" will do it.

For easy access to the usage screen, the alias could be expanded:

     HLP  if nu $1;lbrhlp //;else;if eq $1 //;lbrhlp //
               ;else;libhlp $td1$tu1:$tf1;fi;fi

With this alias, "HLP" with no command line parameters bypasses the 
internal file and directory defaults of LBRHLP.

                           HELP System Commands 

From a menu, pressing a letter or number will take you to the appropriate 
information section.

    CR    Display next information screen.  Also returns to the menu from 
          the end of an information section.
   Space  Next screen (same as CR).
     L    Return to previous information screen.
     S    Return to start of current information section.
     M    Return to previous menu.
     ,    Return to menu for previous level.
     ^    Return to previous level (same as ",").
     .    Return to root (main) menu (level 0).
     P    Send current screen to printer.
    ^P    Send current information section to printer.
    ESC   Exit HELP system.
    ^C    Exit (same as ESC).
:D
                              DISPLAY DETAILS 

On the Index-Screen is in the upper-left corner after the version of LBRHLP 
the Name of the HELP file displayed.  In library mode the display shows the 
library name before the name of the HELP file as "lbrname/hlpfile".


                            Navigation Markers 

The current level in the HELP system hierarchy is displayed in the lower- 
left corner of the screen (except at the root level, level 0).  While in 
information sections, the current screen number is also displayed.

For example:

      1:       Screen 1 of level 0 information section.
   Level 2     Level 2 menu screen.
   Level 1/2   Screen 2 of a level 1 information section.

The last screen of an information section will have the initials "EOI" (end 
of information) immediately preceding the level and screen numbers.
:S

                                 SECURITY 

For remote access systems, security is assured by using the directory 
specification as parsed by the command processor, or the internally 
configured alternate directory.

In addition, the printer cannot be accessed unless the wheel byte is set.  
Non-wheels do not even see the "P" option displayed.
:E

                                  ERRORS 

The ZCPR3 program error flag is set to FFh for most errors, including the 
following:

     Library file not found.
     Library file error (ambigous name or opening error).
     Helpfile (in library) not found.
     Node Level Limit (15) reached.
     Memory overflow, File too large. *
     Unsupported filetype (middle character not "L", "Z", or "Q").
     Uncrunch errors, such as invalid crunched file (LHC only).
     Unsqueeze errors, such as unexpected end-of-file (LHQ only).



* LBRHLP can handle larger files if they are already uncompressed.

                               INSTALLATION 

Several configuration options are available:
                                                        as distributed:
   Default library name . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . HLPFILES
   Library filetype . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . LBR
   Default help file name . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . MENU
   Alternate named directory to search  . . . . . . . . . . HELP:
   Alternate drive and user to search . . . . . . . . . . . A15:
   Check BIOS for "printer ready" before accessing printer  YES
   Suppres formfeed printing  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . NO
   printer standout string  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . none
   printer no-standout string . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . none

Configuration changes are made with ZCNFG and the accompanying LBRHLPnn.CFG 
file.  If the name of the configuration file is not changed, ZCNFG will 
always be able to find it, even if the names LHC or LHQ are changed to 
something else, such as HELP or LBRHLP.  Full explanations for the various 
configuration options are available on the ZCNFG help screens.

                                  HISTORY 

New features in version 2.3:

In previous versions I must know in which library is which HELP file, when 
I invoke LBRHLP.  Now I have added a possibility to change the library into 
the help files with an extended syntax in the form of ":A:-M MENU".  This 
would load the HELP file MENU.HLP from the library M.LBR.  Whitout the 
library extention the files are searched in the default library or 
directory in stand-alone mode. So work all old HELP files and LBR's.  With 
my default HELP file <the main menu> I can now acces to each submenu and to 
each HELP file.  The maximum level I have reduced from 25 to 15, so I could 
save some bytes in the memory because I need the double space to store 
lbrname and filename for each level.  If no default library is defined, 
LBRHLP now searches for single HELP files.  For Printing I have added a 
configurable flag to suppres the formfeed printing after every information. 
So I can print different informations continuous on the same page.  Two
configurable printer strings may be defined for standout and no-standout.

                                HELP Files 

LBRHLP can be used with crunched (LHC), squeezed (LHQ) or uncompressed 
files as single files or help library's. The HELP files can be in three 
different forms:

 - HELP files without index. The file must begin with a colon as first 
   character. The file is displayed continous until end of file.

 - HELP files with automatic index. The file has several information 
   sections, every section begins with a colon in the first column. At the 
   beginning of the file is the index-page, which contains one line for 
   each information section. LBRHLP adds a index-letter to each line. The 
   information sections are beginning with a colon in the first column, so 
   LBRHLP can count the colons to find the sections.

 - HELP files with user index. The file must begin with a leading ";" for 
   the index-page. This page contains the menu for the other information 
   sections. The information sections are beginning with a colon followed 
   by the letter(s) to acces this section.

 HELP Files (continoued): 

For extensive HELP Files you can use submenu calls. You can chain many HELP 
Files to build big HELP's. The syntax is simply, you write in the section 
of the HELP File:

 :1:TEST       -> to load the file TEST.H?P from the current library, (or 
                  the stand-alone file in no library mode).

 :2:-M MENU    -> to load the file MENU.H?P from the library M.LBR. M.LBR 
                  is now the new library to use. The next submenu of the 
                  form as in example 1 would load the HELP file from M.LBR.

NOTE:
Information sections can contain only text or calling submenu. The text 
following the submenu call is ignored!
