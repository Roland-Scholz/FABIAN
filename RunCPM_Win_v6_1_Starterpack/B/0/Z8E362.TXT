Z8E version 3.6.2
=================

This patch release implements fixes for two minor bugs.  The first
was a cursor addressing problem introduced in 3.6 and the second
prevented the loading of symbols from .PRN files generated by
Z80ASM, the SLR assembler.

Z8E362.ARC contains the files in this distribution.  They replace
the corresponding files in Z8E.ARK from volume 85 so for a full
complement of files you need both archives.

Z8E.Z80		Updated source code
Z8E.COM		Patchable binary assembled from Z8E.Z80
Z8E.SYM		Loadaable symbol table for patching Z8E.COM

Z8E is a brilliant debugger for the Z80.  It is about the same
size as ZSID but offers so much more, including interactive
full-screen animated display of instructions and registers.

Originally written by Rick Surwilo in 1984 it underwent a series
of revisions over the next few years.  Apart from contributing
some enhancements of my own, I integrated patches from several
others and attempted to maintain a unified source.  In this I
was largely successful.

This is the first update to Z8E since 1989 and its sole purpose
is to support operation on terminals with more than 24 lines.
For CP/M 2.2 the height of the terminal can be patched but on
CP/M Plus the terminal height is obtained by interrogating the
System Control Block.  No extra bytes were added to the re-
locatable portion of Z8E so the maximum size of a program to be
debugged is undiminished.

As always, if you make changes to this program then please
update the documentation and post it along with the source
code to somewhere accessible to interested people.  Ongoing
development depends on having source code available.
